This is a collection of small python functions that I have used to automatically

- download Genbank files based on a list with Genbank IDs
- subsequently extract information from the Genbank files based on the fields such as "source location"

The functions are dervied from a number of Stackexchange posts that I have been looking through to solve this task.
I have tested the functionality in the Anaconda environment on a Windows PC (http://continuum.io/downloads)
